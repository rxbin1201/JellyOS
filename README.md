# JellyOS 

JellyOS is a hobby project which is always being developed further
I use GNU-EFI and EDK2 for the bootloader.
The operating system is written mainly with C


## Features

- UEFI Bootloader
- Only supports x64 processors
- More coming soon


## Feedback

If you have any ideas I should add let me know


## JellyBoot Loader

The JellyBoot Loader is located at '\\EFI\\BOOT\\BOOTX64.EFI'
It loads `\\EFI\\JellyBoot\\JellyBoot.EFI` located on the boot device such as a usb drive
